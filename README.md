# HearthTrade

The 9th backend project of FreeCodeCamp, I decided to make this a hearthstone trading 'club' instead of a book trading club.


## User stories

User Story: I can view all books posted by every user.

User Story: I can add a new book.

User Story: I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.

User Story: I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.




###Work in progress

Even though currently the user stories are fullfilled I treat this as a work in project and I will keep coming back to it to add tests and iron out some corner cases
